### Code Example:

**Task: Display Command-Line Arguments**
Write a program that takes multiple arguments from the command line and displays each argument on a new line. The program should:
- Print each argument in the same order as provided on the command line.
- Exclude `argv[0]` (the program name) from the output.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

void ft_putchar(char c)
{
    write(1, &c, 1);
}

void ft_putstr(char *str)
{
    int i = 0;
    while (str[i] != '\0')
    {
        ft_putchar(str[i]);
        i++;
    }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int i = 1;
    while (i < argc)
    {
        ft_putstr(argv[i]);
